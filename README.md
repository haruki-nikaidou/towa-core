# Towa Core

This algorithm is designed to generate cryptographic keys based on specified criteria for leading or trailing zeros in the hash output.

It starts by hashing an initial byte vector using SHA-512, and then iteratively modifies this hash according to a given set of conditions (Combination Lock), producing a series of keys.
